# Global optimisation algorithms

## Description

Description of the project

## Dependencies

Before trying to run any of the algorithms, make sure that all the required `Python3` modules are installed correctly. On Unix-like systems, it should be sufficient to run the following from the project home directory.

```bash
    python3 -m pip instal -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

For the usage of each of the three algorithms, please refer to their dedicated `README.md` files.
